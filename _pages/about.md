Hi, I am Wei Li, a final year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. [Erik Cambria](http://www.sentic.net/erikcambria/). I received my Bachelor of Industrial Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2015. After that, I obtained my M.S. in Management Science and Engineering from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2018. I have published several research papers on these topics in top-tier journals. I also serves as an active reviewer of several journals and conferences, e.g., TNNLS, KBS, INFORM FUSION, NEUCOM, COLING, AAAI, EMNLP, ACL, and EACL.

My diverse educational background (biology, industrial engineering, management science and computer science) gives me the confidence to take on challenging work across different fields. I am also eager to collaborate with people from different domains. My current research interests include: **Sentiment Analysis**, **Explainable Artificial Intelligence**, and **Conversational Emotion-cause Pair Extraction**. Besides, I have close collaboration with my teammates in **Persona-based Dialogue Generation**. Please click [publications](/publications/) or [![GitHub](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tskMh.png) GitHub](https://github.com/Maxwe11y) on the navigation bar for detailed information. During my leisure time, I like playing snooker and swimming.

### what I did in research during PhD study <img align="right" width="360" height="200" src="/assets/img/picture2.pdf"/>
  <ul>
    <li>I presented a framework for conversational sentiment analysis using generalized neural tensor network as a contextulizer.<li>
    <li>I proposed to further improve the performance of conversational sentiment analysis by integrating utterance-level symbolic knowledge and concept-level symbolic knowledge.</li>
    <li>I introduced a new task to extract emotion-cause pairs from conversations and built a new dataset accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
