Hi, I am Luyao ZHU, a 4-th year PhD candidate at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. [Erik Cambria](http://www.sentic.net/erikcambria/) and Dr. [Rui Mao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-mao-nlp/). I obtained my M.S. in management science and engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019. Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics and B.Ec. in Econimics from China University of Political Science and Law in 2016. 

The multiple education backgrounds in different majors enable me to quickly adapt to a new domain. I am always ready to take on new challenges, advancing the frontiers of knowlege and research. My current research interests include: **semi-supervised learning**, **zero-shot learning**, **persona attribute extraction**, and **persona-based dialogue generation**. Besides, I have close collaboration with my teammates in **sentiment analysis**. For more information, please click [publications](/publications/) or [![GitHub](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tskMh.png) GitHub](https://github.com/Cyn7hia) on the navigation bar. During my spare time, I like drawing and cooking.

### what I did in research during PhD study <img align="right" width="360" height="200" src="/assets/img/picture2.pdf"/>
  <ul>
    <li>I proposed to detect the interlocutor intent for open-domain conversation and train the intent detector via semi-supervised learning.</li>
    <li>I developed a persona-based dialouge system for chit-chat, enabling the chatbot to generate more persona-consistent and contextual coherent responses.</li>
    <li>I developed a framework for extracting persona attributes from conversations.</li>
  </ul>
